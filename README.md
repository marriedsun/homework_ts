첫 수업 및 git 설정, 리액트 강의 공부시작 실습환경구축

2025.10.6
리액트 1-3 소스코드수정방법 (유튜브강의시청하며 따라함)
app.js index.js app.css index html 등
수정 및 build 명령어로 배포까지 완료

리액트 책 계획은 토,일 밤시간 활용 (3시간정도 가능할듯) 월,화 (장사는 안하고 시간활용은 미정)
그래도 한 달 안에 최대한 끝내볼 예정.

(푸시하면서 gitignore 랑 README 파일이 충돌해서 조금 애먹음..
 git checkout --theirs .gitignore README.md
 git add .gitignore README.md
 git rebase --continue
 git push -u origin main --force-with-lease
 등등 이용해서 해결. 원격의 최근 커밋이 지워질 수 있다고 해서 그런지 
 처음 README 에 서영이가 적어준 내용이 없이 아래 내용들이 추가됨.)



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
